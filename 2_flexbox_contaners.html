    		<h2>Tourism in Kazakhstan</h2>
    		<p>Kazakhstan is the ninth-largest country by area and the largest landlocked country. Today, tourism is not a major component of the economy. As of 2014, tourism has accounted for 0.3% of Kazakhstan GDP, but the government has plans to increase it to 3% by 2020.[1][2] The country inherited the culture of the ancient Silk Road, Nomadic lifestyle, and Soviet Union which had a great influence on its formation. This mixture makes Kazakhstan so different from any other country in the region and in the world</p>
